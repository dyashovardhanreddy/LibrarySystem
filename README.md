# ðŸ“š Library System

## Overview  
This is a **Spring Boot-based Library System API**. The application allows users to **retrieve books** from the library, while **authorized users (Admins)** can **add and delete books**.  

The project implements **JWT authentication**, ensuring secure access where users authenticate once and use their access token for subsequent requests.

## Features  
-  **Add a Book** â€“ Admin users can add books to the library.  
-  **Delete a Book (by ID)** â€“ Admin users can remove books from the system.  
-  **Retrieve All Books** â€“ Any authenticated user can list all books.  
-  **Retrieve a Book (by ID)** â€“ Any authenticated user can fetch book details.  
-  **JWT Authentication** â€“ Users authenticate using **username/password** and receive an **access token** for secure API access.  
-  **Refresh Token Support** â€“ Allows users to renew access tokens without re-authenticating.

##  Technologies Used  
###  Backend  
- **Spring Boot** â€“ Framework for building the API.  
- **Spring Security** â€“ Handles authentication & authorization.  
- **Java 17** â€“ Primary programming language.  

### Database
